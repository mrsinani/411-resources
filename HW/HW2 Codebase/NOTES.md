# Notes

## Docstring standard
Following: https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html

Make sure to follow this standard for the assignment. 

**Important**: There are several cases where a documentation standard must be chosen and stuck to throughout the codebase. For documenting attributes/parameters for a function, I prefer documenting it in the `Args` section rather than an inline docstring directly under the variable. And just for consistency, since all other functions get their docstring within their function body, I will be including the docstring for the `__init__` files *within* its own body. The alternative would have been to include the `__init__` docstring within the `Class` docstring. Check the following code blocks for more clarity. 

*** Below is the documentation standards we are to follow: ***

### Non-method functions

```python
def function_with_pep484_type_annotations(param1: int, param2: str) -> bool:
    """Example function with PEP 484 type annotations.

    Args:
        param1: The first parameter.
        param2: The second parameter.

    Returns:
        The return value. True for success, False otherwise.

    """
```

### Classes and their methods

```python
class ExampleClass(object):
    """The summary line for a class docstring should fit on one line.

    If the class has public attributes, they may be documented here
    in an ``Attributes`` section and follow the same formatting as a
    function's ``Args`` section. Alternatively, attributes may be documented
    inline with the attribute's declaration (see __init__ method below).

    Properties created with the ``@property`` decorator should be documented
    in the property's getter method.

    Attributes:
        attr1 (str): Description of `attr1`.
        attr2 (:obj:`int`, optional): Description of `attr2`.

    """

    def __init__(self, param1, param2, param3):
        """Example of docstring on the __init__ method.

        The __init__ method may be documented in either the class level
        docstring, or as a docstring on the __init__ method itself.

        Either form is acceptable, but the two should not be mixed. Choose one
        convention to document the __init__ method and be consistent with it.

        Note:
            Do not include the `self` parameter in the ``Args`` section.

        Args:
            param1 (str): Description of `param1`.
            param2 (:obj:`int`, optional): Description of `param2`. Multiple
                lines are supported.
            param3 (:obj:`list` of :obj:`str`): Description of `param3`.

        """
        self.attr1 = param1
        self.attr2 = param2
        self.attr3 = param3  #: Doc comment *inline* with attribute

        #: list of str: Doc comment *before* attribute, with type specified
        self.attr4 = ['attr4']

        self.attr5 = None
        """str: Docstring *after* attribute, with type specified."""

    @property
    def readonly_property(self):
        """str: Properties should be documented in their getter method."""
        return 'readonly_property'

    @property
    def readwrite_property(self):
        """:obj:`list` of :obj:`str`: Properties with both a getter and setter
        should only be documented in their getter method.

        mentioned here.

        return ['readwrite_property']

            Do not include the `self` parameter in the ``Args`` section.

        Args:
            param1: The first parameter.
            param2: The second parameter.

        Returns:
            True if successful, False otherwise.

        """
        return True

    def __special__(self):
        """By default special members with docstrings are not included.

        This behavior can be enabled by changing the following setting in
        Sphinx's conf.py::
